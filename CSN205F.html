                {
                    question: "Which of the following network commands, following the command router ospf 1, tells this router to start using OSPF on interfaces whose IP addresses are 10.1.1.1, 10.1.100.1, and 10.1.120.1?",
                    choices: ["network 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 area 0", "network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0", "network 10.0.0.1 0.0.0.255 area 0", "network 10.0.0.1 0.0.255.255 area 0", "network 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0"],
                    correct: ["network 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0"],
                    explanation: "The network 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 area 0 command matches all IP addresses that begin with 10.1, enabling OSPF in area 0 on all interfaces. The answer with wildcard mask 0.255.255.0 is illegal because it represents more than one string of binary 0s separated by binary 1s. The answer with x’s is syntactically incorrect. The answer with wildcard mask 255.0.0.0 means “Match all addresses whose last three octets are 0.0.0,” so none of the three interfaces are matched."
                },
                {
                    question: "Which of the following commands list the OSPF neighbors off interface serial 0/0? (Choose two answers.)",
                    choices: ["show ip ospf neighbor", "show ip ospf interface brief", "show ip neighbor", "show ip interface", "show ip ospf neighbor serial 0/0"],
                    correct: ["show ip ospf neighbor", "show ip ospf neighbor serial 0/0"],
                    explanation: "Of the three wrong answers, two are real commands that simply do not list the OSPF neighbors. show ip ospf interface brief lists interfaces on which OSPF is enabled but does not list neighbors. show ip interface lists IPv4 details about interfaces, but none related to OSPF. One incorrect answer, show ip neighbor, is not a valid IOS command."
                },
                {
                    question: "Routers R1, R2, and R3 are internal routers in areas 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Router R4 is an ABR connected to the backbone area (0) and to areas 1, 2, and 3. Which of the following answers describes the configuration on Router R4, which is different from the other three routers, that makes it an ABR?",
                    choices: ["The ABR enable router subcommand", "The network router subcommands refer to a single non-backbone area.", "The network router subcommands refer to multiple areas, including the backbone.", "The router has an interface in area 0, whereas an OSPF neighbor's interface sits in a different area."],
                    correct: ["The network router subcommands refer to multiple areas, including the backbone."],
                    explanation: "An Area Border Router (ABR) in OSPF connects different areas to the backbone area (Area 0). The key difference in configuration for an ABR compared to other routers is that the network router subcommand within the OSPF configuration includes both the backbone area (Area 0) and other non-backbone areas. This allows the ABR to participate in routing within and between multiple areas, including the backbone."
                },
                {
                    question: "An engineer connects to Router R1 and issues a show ip ospf neighbor command. The status of neighbor 2.2.2.2 lists FULL/BDR. What does the BDR mean?",
                    choices: ["R1 is an Area Border Router.", "R1 is a backup designated router.", "Router 2.2.2.2 is an Area Border Router.", "Router 2.2.2.2 is a backup designated router."],
                    correct: ["Router 2.2.2.2 is a backup designated router."],
                    explanation: "R1 is an Area Border Router: While R1 could be an ABR (and likely is, given it's connected to multiple areas), the 'BDR' designation in the neighbor status refers specifically to its role on that particular segment, not its overall ABR status. R1 is a backup designated router: Although R1 could be the BDR on this segment, the output clearly indicates that 2.2.2.2 is the BDR, not R1. Router 2.2.2.2 is an Area Border Router: Router 2.2.2.2 could be an ABR, but the neighbor status 'FULL/BDR' tells us its role on this specific segment, which is backup DR. Router 2.2.2.2 is a backup designated router: This is the correct answer, as confirmed by the OSPF neighbor status."
                },
                {
                    question: "An engineer migrates from a more traditional OSPFv2 configuration that uses network commands in OSPF configuration mode to instead use OSPFv2 interface configuration. Which of the following commands configures the area number assigned to an interface in this net configuration?",
                    choices: ["The area command in interface configuration mode", "The ip ospf command in interface configuration mode", "The router ospf command in interface configuration mode", "the network command in interface configuration mode"],
                    correct: ["The ip ospf command in interface configuration mode"],
                    explanation: "With OSPFv2 interface configuration mode, the configuration looks just like the traditional configuration, with a couple of exceptions. The network router subcommand is no longer required. Instead, each interface on which OSPF should be enabled is configured with an ip ospf process-id area area-id interface subcommand. This command refers to the OSPF routing process that should be enabled on the interface and specifies the OSPFv2 area."
                },
                {
                    question: "Which of the following configuration settings on a router does not influence which IPv4 router choose to add to its IPv4 routing table when using OSPFv2?",
                    choices: ["auto-cost reference-bandwidth", "delay", "bandwidth", "ip ospf cost"],
                    correct: ["delay"],
                    explanation: "SPF calculates the cost of a route as the sum of the OSPF interface costs for all outgoing interfaces in the route. The interface cost can be set directly (ip ospf cost), or IOS uses a default based on the reference bandwidth and the interface bandwidth. Of the listed answers, delay is the only setting that does not influence OSPFv2 metric calculations."
                },
                {
                    question: "Two routers using OSPFv2 have become neighbors and exchanged all LSAs. As a result, Router R1 now lists some OSPF-learned routes in its routing table. Which of the following best describes how R1 uses those recently learned LSAs to choose which IP routes to add to its IP routing table?",
                    choices: ["Each LSA lists a route to be copied to the routing table", "Some LSAs list a route that can be copied to the routing table", "Run some SPF math against the LSAs to calculate the routes.", "R1 does not use the LSAs at all when choosing what routes to add"],
                    correct: ["Run some SPF math against the LSAs to calculate the routes."],
                    explanation: "LSAs contain topology information that is useful in calculating routes, but the LSAs do not directly list the route that a router should add to its routing table. In this case, R1 would run a calculation called the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm, against the LSAs, to determine what IP routes to add to the IP routing table."
                },
                {
                    question: "A PC connects to a LAN and uses DHCP to lease an IP address for the first time. Of the usual four DHCP messages that flow between the PC and the DHCP server, which ones do the client send? (Choose two answers.)",
                    choices: ["Acknowledgment", "Discover", "Offer", "Request"],
                    correct: ["Discover", "Request"],
                    explanation: "The client sends a Discover message, with the server returning an Offer message. The client then sends a Request, with the server sending back the IP address in the Acknowledgment message."
                },
                {
                    question: "An enterprise puts the DHCP and DNS servers on VLAN 10/subnet 10 in Atlanta, using IP address 10.1.10.1 for the DHCP server and 10.1.10.2 for the DNS server. A remote router sits in Boston, with devices on the Boston LAN using the DHCP and DNS servers in Atlanta. Which of the following needs to be configured in the routers in this enterprise to support DHCP and DNS?",
                    choices: ["The ip helper-address 10.1.10.1 command in the Atlanta router", "The ip helper-address 10.1.10.2 command in the Boston router", "The ip name-server 10.1.10.2 command in the Atlanta router", "The ip dhcp-server 10.1.10.1 command in the Boston router", "None of the other answers are correct"],
                    correct: ["None of the other answers are correct"],
                    explanation: "Of the commands in the answers, three list syntactically correct commands but one does not: ip dhcp-server 10.1.10.1. The answer with this command is incorrect. The ip helper-address 10.1.10.1 command is indeed needed as an interface subcommand, but only on remote routers like the Boston router. This command is not needed for the DNS server, so while the ip helper-address 10.1.10.2 command would be accepted, it does not help DNS or DHCP work. Finally, the ip name-server 10.1.10.2 command on the Atlanta router works, but it simply lets users of the Atlanta router CLI make use of the DNS server; it has no effect on user DNS traffic. The Boston router would need an ip helper-address 10.1.10.1 command, so that the Boston router could forward DHCP requests to the DHCP server in Atlanta."
                },
                {
                    question: "Fred decides to migrate from an old DHCP server platform to use a Cisco router at the headquarters building. This DHCP server, created with configuration in IOS on a Cisco router, supports 200 remote subnets. Which of the following settings are made outside of a per-subnet pool of addresses?",
                    choices: ["Client IP address", "Addresses in that subnet excluded from being leased by the server", "Default router", "DNS server", "Length of address lease"],
                    correct: ["Addresses in that subnet excluded from being leased by the server"],
                    explanation: "The configuration puts the per-client settings in a DHCP pool: client IP address, mask, default router, and DNS server IP addresses. The pool also lists the length of time for which the client can keep the lease for the address. Only the exclude list (ip dhcp exclude-address) sits outside the DHCP pool."
                },
                {
                    question: "PC1, a new PC, just booted for the first time when connected to an enterprise network. PC1 used DHCP to lease IP address 10.1.1.1, learning mask 255.255.255.0, DNS server 10.9.9.9, and default gateway 10.1.1.2, with a lease time of 7 days. Assume that the PC has sent nothing else over the network because the DHCP process completed. The user then opens a web browser and types www.ciscopress.com. Which of the following actions happens next?",
                    choices: ["PC1 sends an ARP request to find the web server’s MAC address.", "PC1 sends an ARP request to find the default gateway’s (10.1.1.2) MAC address.", "PC1 sends a DNS request about www.ciscopress.com to the DNS server (10.9.9.9).", "PC1 sends an IP packet to the www.ciscopress.com web server IP address."],
                    correct: ["PC1 sends an ARP request to find the default gateway’s (10.1.1.2) MAC address."],
                    explanation: "If a host does not yet have an IPv4 address assigned to it, the first action should be to try to lease an address with DHCP. The question begins as if that process had completed, but also that nothing else had happened on the network. That statement is meant to say that no ARPs had flowed, no DNS messages had flowed, and certainly no user messages. When the user types www.ciscopress.com into his browser window, PC1 needs to resolve the name into its IPv4 address. However, the DNS, 10.9.9.9, is on a different subnet than PC1. PC1 does not learn an ARP entry for the default router during the DHCP process. (Remember, all those DHCP messages sent by the DHCP client are not sent to the router’s MAC address.) So, although PC1’s next primary action is to resolve the name www.ciscopress.com to learn its IP address, the literal next message sent by PC1 is an ARP request. As a result, PC1 learns R1’s MAC address, and can then forward the DNS request to R1. Of the incorrect answers, after the ARP request to find the default router’s MAC address, PC1 will send a DNS request, and then send an IP packet to the server’s IP address. And if the server just happens to be in the same subnet as PC1, PC1 would also ARP to find the web server’s IP address."
                },
                {
                    question: "A packet is sent to a destination address. That single packet is routed through the network to the final router, which then sends the packet to all hosts connected to that one subnet. Which of the following IP address types was used as the destination IP address?",
                    choices: ["A unicast address", "A network broadcast address", "A subnet broadcast address", "A multicast address"],
                    correct: ["A subnet broadcast address"],
                    explanation: "By definition, a subnet broadcast (a packet sent to a subnet broadcast address), also called a directed broadcast, is routed like any other packet until it arrives at a router connected to that subnet. For that last forwarding step, the router encapsulates the IP packet in an Ethernet broadcast frame (destination MAC address FFFF.FFFF.FFFF), so that all hosts in the destination subnet receive a copy. A unicast packet would not be forwarded as a data link broadcast at the last step. A network broadcast would be replicated by different routers as needed so that it was delivered to all subnets in the classful network. A multicast packet would be delivered to a subset of subnets, depending on which subnets had hosts that had formerly asked to receive packets sent to that particular multicast address."
                },
                {
                    question: "A packet is sent to a destination address. That single packet is replicated by a few routers based on the routers’ knowledge of hosts that had earlier registered to receive packets sent to that destination address. The routers do not forward copies of the packet onto subnets where no hosts have registered, and do forward copies of the packet onto subnets where at least one host has registered to receive those packets. Which of the following IP address types was used as the destination IP address?",
                    choices: ["A unicast address", "A network broadcast address", "A subnet broadcast address", "A multicast address"],
                    correct: ["A multicast address"],
                    explanation: "By definition, a multicast IP packet (a packet sent to a Class D IP multicast address) is copied as necessary by routers to make extra copies and forwarded to multiple routers as needed, but not all. The logic revolves around prior knowledge of a host registration process by which hosts declare their interest in receiving packets sent to a particular multicast IP address. Routers exchange this information, so that when a new multicast packet arrives, the routers know where to send copies of that particular multicast packet and where to not bother to send the packet (because no hosts in that part of the network registered to receive a copy). A unicast packet would not be forwarded as a data link broadcast at the last step. A network broadcast would be replicated by different routers as needed so that it was delivered to all subnets in the classful network. A subnet broadcast would be routed as a single packet to the final router in the path. That router would then forward the IP packet as a LAN broadcast so that all hosts in that subnet would receive a copy."

                    question: "What does the command ip helper-address server-ip do?",

                    correct: ["Identifies the DHCP server by its IP address"],
                    explanation: "The command ip helper-address server-ip requests that the DHCP server help users obtain IP addresses. It essentially acts as a DHCP relay, forwarding DHCP broadcast messages from a local network to a designated DHCP server on a different network."

                    question: "Which of the following RSTP port states have the same name and purpose as a port state in traditional 802.1D STP? (Choose two answers.)",
                    choices: ["Blocking", "Forwarding", "Listening", "Learning", "Discarding"],
                    correct: ["Forwarding", "Learning"],
                    explanation: "RSTP uses port state forwarding, learning, and discarding. Forwarding and learning perform the same functions as the port states used by traditional STP."

                    question: "RSTP adds some concepts to STP that enable ports to be used for a role if another port on the same switch fails. Which of the following statements correctly describe a port role that is waiting to take over for another port role? (Choose two answers.)",
                    choices: ["An alternate port waits to become a root port.", "A backup port waits to become a root port", "An alternate port waits to become a designated port.", "A backup port waits to become a designated port."],

                    explanation: "With RSTP, an alternate port is an alternate to the root port when a switch’s root port fails. A backup port takes over for a designated port if the designated port fails."

                    choices: ["STP", "EtherChannel", "Root Guard", "PortFast"],
                    correct: ["PortFast"],
                    explanation: "The PortFast feature allows STP to move a port from blocking to forwarding without going through the interim listening and learning states. STP allows this exception when the link is known to have no switch on the other end of the link, removing the risk of a switching loop. BPDU Guard is a common feature to use at the same time as PortFast because it watches for incoming bridge protocol data units (BPDU), which should not happen on an access port, and prevents the loops from a rogue switch by disabling the port."

                    correct: ["spanning-tree vlan vlan-number priority value", "spanning-tree vlan vlan-number root {primary | secondary}"],
                    explanation: "spanning-tree vlan vlan-number priority value: This command directly modifies the bridge priority for a specific VLAN. By changing the priority, you are influencing the bridge ID, as the bridge ID is comprised of priority and the switch's MAC address. spanning-tree vlan vlan-number root {primary | secondary}: While this command doesn't directly modify the bridge ID, it sets the switch as either the primary or secondary root bridge for the specified VLAN. Changing the root bridge status can effectively change the overall topology and how the bridge ID affects the network."
